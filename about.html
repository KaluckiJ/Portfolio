						"<strong>Joe has an incredible work ethic and a "can do" attitude</strong>, always willing to learn something new and try a new approach. He has a strong technical aptitude and is also very self-motivated, working well independently yet making significant contributions to team meetings as well. Joe has a passion for social media and makes good use of applying B2C techniques in a B2B environment. Finally, Joe is immensely well-liked by all his colleagues and really contributes to a positive team environment." <p> - Jessica Kemp, Manager at Alexander Street Press

						"<strong>I have worked with Joe for two years</strong>. Ever since I joined Alexander Street Press as Director of Filmakers Library, Joe made himself available to help me with all sorts of projects.<p>
						He has been wonderfully helpful on various marketing projects that I had to handle - often with time pressure involved. One example was when we had to prepare for an educational conference, in October, 2011. Joe to put together a "show reel" comprised of film clips from four new Filmakers Library films. Joe looked at the films, selected the best clips from each and edited it together in a very compelling and attractive way.Very impressive.<p>
						I believe Joe's warm and winning personality, energy, and knowledge will make him a great asset for any organization." <p> - Andrea Traubner, Colleague at Alexander Street Press

						"<strong>Over the course of the last 8 weeks</strong>, I had the pleasure of teaching Joe Kalucki within my Web Development 101 class through the New York Code & Design Academy. We covered html and css development, basic web design concepts, responsive web design and adding interactivity through the use of javascript and jQuery. We also covered the conceptual basis behind web development from server to client and touched a bit on backend development through ruby.<p>
						Joe consistently showed a quick grasp of the material. His two independent projects were both technical sound and showed a good eye for design. He finished his assignment quickly and efficiently and seemed to have genuine interesting in pushing his skill further on his own. I'd vouch for his ability to push his skills in later projects in a second. One of my best." <p> - Warren Longmire, Instructor at New York Code and Design Academy
